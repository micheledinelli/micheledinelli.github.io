I am 25 years old and I was born in Cento, a small town in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, near Bologna and Ferrara. I studied languages (German, Spanish and English) at high school. I discovered computer science quite late but I quickly became fascinated by it and decided to study it further at the University of Bologna. I graduated in March 2023 and now I'm pursuing my Master's degree. I like backend software development, programming languages and cryptography.

I am teaching assistant for Algorithms and Data Structures and Software Engineering courses. I also work as research assistant for the Computer Science department.

In my free time, I enjoy running, hiking, and exploring new technologies.
